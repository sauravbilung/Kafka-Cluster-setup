Steps :

****************** Setting up zookeeper quorum ******************

1) 3 is sufficient, for larger clusters say broker size is like 100 go for 5 quorom size zookeeper.
2) For setting up zookeeper refer the zookeeper directory. It has all the required configuarations needed.
3) Zookeeper AWS Setup
    -- Select the region with 3 minimum subnets(VPC -> Subnets)
    -- Launch EC2 instances(Refer docs/google for configs, launch the intances in the mentioned subnets by assigning primary IP belonging to
    the CIDR block of the subnets)
4) How to SSH into the instance :
    -- chmod 0600 key.pem file
    -- ssh -i key.pem  user@IPv4_public_IP (Eg: ssh -i key.pem ubuntu@ipaddress)
5) Zookeeper Single Machine Setup 
    -- Setup directory -> setup-1-zookeeper-single.sh (setup the DNS as per the primary IP of the ec2 instance)
6) Zookeeper Service setup 
    -- Copy contents from Zookeeper directory -> zookeeper file to /etc/init.d/zookeeper as per the zookeeper steps
       mentioned in setup-1-zookeeper-single.sh
    -- Follow on with the remaining steps in setup-1-zookeeper-single.sh
7) Using zookeeper command line interface 
    -- zookeeper directory -> zookeeper-shell-examples.sh 

8) Single Zookeeper cluster will be up and running till this setup 
9) Zookeeper quorum setup (Part 1 - AWS)
   -- Create an image from the already created EC2 instance.    
   -- Verify snapshots has been created by going to EC2 -> snapshots
   -- Creating an Image takes some time 5-10 minutes.
   -- Launch using AMI (EC2->Images->AMIs-> select image -> Launch)
   -- Same steps as in Step 3 (use the same key file, choose appropriate subnets,primary IPs,etc)
   -- ssh as per in step 4
10) Zookeeper Quorum Setup (Part 2 - Zookeeper)
   -- Refer setup-2-zookeeper-quorom.sh
   -- Perform the steps on all the EC2 instances.
   -- Copy the zookeeper directory -> zookeeper.properties file to appropriate directory as mentioned in the script file.
11) Zookeeper 4 letter words for testing/Debugging the cluster.
   -- Refer zookeeper directory -> four-letter-words.sh
